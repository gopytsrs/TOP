# The Odin Project: Project Rock Paper Scissors

**What I've gained from doing this project:**
* Learned to use functional programming using javascript
* Basic use of CSS flexbox (still need to solve the spacing and margins)
* More familiar with HTML, CSS and JS syntax.
* Boostrap for the buttons (could do more)

**To do next(if time allows):**
* Update the website with imgs
* Use a framework to recreate the website (React?)
