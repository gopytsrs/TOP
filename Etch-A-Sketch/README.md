# Etch-a-Sketch

**This project involves creating an Etch-a-Sketch using HTML, CSS and Javascript**

**What I've learned:**

- DOM Manipulation
- DOM Nodes (Parent/Children nodes)
- Events, adding and listening to events using Javascript
- More familiar with flexbox styling and properties
- More familiar with HTML/CSS and Javascript syntax
- More familiar with Git commands

**To add in the future:**

- Prevent scrolling of page
- After every mouseover event, each square in the grid gets darker and eventually becomes black after 10 mouseovers
- Better way to center button
